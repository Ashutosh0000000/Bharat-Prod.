🚀Built a Production-Ready Product Discovery Platform 🇮🇳
After weeks of backend-heavy engineering, I built and deployed a scalable product platform — not a demo, not a tutorial.

✅ Mode-based product discovery (backend-driven)
✅ Efficient pagination & advanced filtering
✅ Redis caching to reduce PostgreSQL load
✅ Analytics dashboard with real metrics
✅ Fully Dockerized & deployed (Render)

Tech: FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, Streamlit, Docker, Render

This project changed how I think about performance, scale, and real-world backend systems.

📬 Open to backend / Software/Remote platform engineering opportunities.
Would love feedback from fellow engineers.

#BackendEngineering #FastAPI #Python #Redis #PostgreSQL
#Docker #SystemDesign #OpenToWork

This was a full end-to-end build:

* API-level pagination & query optimization
* Price / category / rating sorting at DB level
* Redis caching with TTL & invalidation
* Streamlit used as admin + discovery UI
* Real deployment, real trade-offs

Happy to explain design decisions or architecture
